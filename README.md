playground
==========

Just a playground space for one-off tests/concepts/examples. A lot of it will be mostly snippets copied from others and slightly rewritten to get to a POC quickly. 

Unless otherwise specified in a subdir, all content original by me should be considered in the Public Domain. All content that I copied from others while running tests will include the appropriate attribution notes and license.
