This playground dir will eventually become a repo on its own right. 
The tools' names are now explicitly large and sometimes repetitive for the sake of clarity, as while I experiment, I will have multiple tools doing almost the same thing, while if and when this becomes a standalone repo, each tool will do a specific job alone
